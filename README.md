# Classification of Blood cells using Neural Networks

## Overview
The aim of this project is to design convolutional neural networks to classify blood cells and compare different models metrics. 

## Dataset
Dataset can be found at:
* !https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/snkd93bnjr/1


## Requirements
* Numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn
* tensorflow
* keras
* sklearn


## Setting up 

The programs above were created using Google collab, here it will explain how to set up a google collab account and run the programs. 

First, an account is required to use google collab, if you do not have one you can sign up at https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp

Once an account is created go to https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index and create a new notebook and use the following code below to clone this repository.


!git clone https://github.com/kateh321/Mathproject
